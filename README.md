# Game

This project is extensively based and inspired by the arcade "Tron" game. It is a multiplayer Snake-like 2D game with a few enhancements like a teleporter or bonus.

This game was partly made in context to an inter-university "Monthly Game Jam" event organized by Conjure Games, ETS Game Development club and Game Dev McGill.
